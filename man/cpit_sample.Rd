\description{
Calculate conditional probability integral transform (PIT) values for probabilistic
forecasts in the form of samples or ensembles.
}
\details{
The calibration of probabilistic forecasts is typically assessed by checking whether or not
probability integral transform (PIT) values resemble a sample from a standard uniform
distribution. Conditional PIT (cPIT) values allow forecast calibration to be assessed whilst
focusing on a particular range of outcomes [\code{a}, \code{b}]. This is achieved by restricting attention
to the observed values \code{y} that are between \code{a} and \code{b}, and calculating the PIT values
corresponding to the conditional distribution given that the observation is in this range
(see references for details).

The arguments \code{a} and \code{b} are numerical values corresponding to the lower and upper bound of
the interval of interest. If we wish to assess forecast calibration when predicting outcomes
that exceed a threshold \code{t}, then we can set \code{a = t} and \code{b = Inf}.

By default, \code{NA} is returned for the entries of \code{y} that are not in the specified range, with
the cPIT value corresponding to `y` returned otherwise. The default output of the functions is
therefore a numeric vector of the same length as \code{y}. If \code{return_na = FALSE}, these \code{NA}'s are
not returned, and the output is instead a numeric containing just the valid cPIT values.

\code{cpit_sample()} calculates conditional PIT values for forecast distributions
in the form of an ensemble or predictive sample. See the documentation for
\code{\link{cpit_param}} for details on conditional PIT histograms.

Calculating conditional PIT values requires the conditional predictive distribution
given that the outcome is in the range [\code{a}, \code{b}]. This is achieved here
by first smoothing the predictive sample using kernel density estimation.

\code{\link{cpit_param()}} allows cPIT values to be calculated for a range of
parametric distributions. \code{cpit_sample()} provides functionality to compute
these values for forecasts in the form of an ensemble or sample from a predictive distribution.
The argument \code{dat} contains the sample from the forecast distribution. This
should be a matrix with the same number of rows as the length of \code{y}, with
the columns representing different samples or ensemble members.

If the argument \code{kde = TRUE}, the sample will be smoothed using Gaussian kernel density
estimation prior to calculating the cPIT values; the default is \code{kde = FALSE}. The argument
\code{bw} specifies the bandwidth parameter to use within kernel density estimation.
If this is not provided, then it is selected using the core function \code{\link{bw.nrd}}.
